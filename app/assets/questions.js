        question: "What is linear search algorithm about?",
        answer: "Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element of the list sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list. It is a basic algorithm used to find elements in a list.",

        question: "What is binary search algorithm about?",
        answer: "Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval is empty. It is a popular algorithm used to find elements in a sorted list.",
      },
